# Provable Determinism in Reactors

This repository contains a [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean)-based formalization of a small subset of the Reactor model (cf. [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca)), as well as a proof of its determinism.
This work was done for my bachelor thesis, so there's also a written thesis and written versions of the defense presentation and a talk about Lean in this repository.
