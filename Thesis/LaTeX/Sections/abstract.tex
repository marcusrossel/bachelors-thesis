\section*{Abstract}

Reactors are a novel model of computation introduced in ``Reactors: A Deterministic Model for Composable Reactive Systems'' \cite{cyphy}. 
A core claim of this model is that it behaves predictably under certain conditions, i.e. it is deterministic. 
Currently, its mathematical model is neither well-defined nor verified.  
In this thesis we formalize a well-defined subset of the Reactor model and rigorously prove its determinism.
To ensure correctness of our mathematical work, we employ a modern approach to formalization, by using a proof assistant: \emph{Lean Theorem Prover}.
Along the way we show some of the unique aspects of working with Lean.
